## Fir - Command line task management

<small>This project is in development & subject to breaking changes.</small>

Configurable command line task management tool inspired by emacs org mode & web based task management tools.

### Features
- Support for multiple profiles allowing the user to easily switch between task lists. 
- Toml configuration files, easy for humans and source control. See: [example](./fir.v1.todo.toml)
- Configurable outputs (& more to come)
- Support for tags, due dates, assigned people, notes and more
- Configurable statuses, with 3 status categories todo, doing, done (on hold category coming soon).

View tasks with `fir ls` to see all ongoing tasks:

Or
- `fir done` shows all completed tasks
- `fir todo` shows tasks on the todo list
- `fir prog` shows tasks that are currently in progress

### Upcoming features ideas
- Backlog for tasks that don't show in the regular task lists, but exist in the background ready to be pulled forward.
- Forth status category for tasks that are on hold
- Tracking dates for when the work started & finished (based on when they move status groups)
- Better documentation, help commands etc
